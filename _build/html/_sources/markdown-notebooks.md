# Conclusions
Now that we have established our workflow, updates to our program will be published on a weekly basis and the URL will be sent to the student team as well as the teaching team in the first five minutes of each class session. A question not to ask: shall we ever need to annotate our .do files if we can offer much richer documentation in e-books built using .html?
